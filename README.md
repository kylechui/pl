# `pl`

A very basic interpreter for a very basic programming language. Written mostly
for pedagogical purposes, and without a very good design

## TODO

- Add more basic arithmetic operations
  - Minus, multiplication, division, floating point counterparts
- List parsing
- Spread notation using `..`
- Function/module-level comments
